						<h2>Historical founder and manager of Radio ABF</h2><p><strong>DJ, producer, music programmer, technical manager</strong></p><p><strong>Loïc Molo</strong> is a <strong>French electronic music producer, DJ</strong>, <strong>radio veteran</strong>, <strong>music programmer</strong>, and <strong>technical manager</strong> based in <strong>Paris</strong>. With more than <strong>25 years</strong> of experience in radio production, hosting, and station management, he is the <strong>historical founder</strong> and current manager of <strong>Radio ABF</strong> (Alternative Bass Fréquence), the independent online station dedicated to bass, house, electro, and electronic music that he helped launch in <strong>1999</strong> and successfully relaunched in <strong>2026</strong>.</p><h3>Radio Journey</h3><p>Loïc began his career in 1999 at <strong>Radio FG</strong>, where he worked in production and weekend animation during the explosive rise of French webradios and French touch electro music. That same year, he laid the foundations for <strong>Radio ABF</strong>, a project born from his vision of a free, alternative platform focused on underground and bass-driven sounds.</p><p>From <strong>2000 to 2008</strong>, ABF became one of the early pioneers of French digital radio. In 2008, the project evolved into <strong>M2 Radio</strong> (a larger bouquet of thematic stations), which Loïc co-founded alongside Alexandre Martinat (Fréquence3). After years of development behind the scenes, Loïc brought <strong>Radio ABF</strong> back to life in 2026, returning it to its original roots: authentic, independent programming, high-quality streams, and a strong community focus — now accessible at <a href="https://radioabf.com">radioabf.com</a>.</p><h3>Music Production &amp; DJing</h3><p>Alongside his radio work, Loïc has transitioned into <strong>music creation</strong>. As a producer, he releases <strong>melodic</strong> and <strong>atmospheric</strong> electronic tracks under his own name, available on major platforms including <strong>Beatport</strong>, <strong>Spotify</strong>, <strong>Apple Music</strong>, <strong>Deezer</strong>, and <strong>YouTube Music</strong>. Notable releases include the single <strong>"Rise and Reclaim"</strong> (late 2025) and several upcoming projects in melodic house/techno and ambient-leaning electronica.</p><p>He also performs as a <strong>DJ</strong>, curates playlists, and programs the station’s content, ensuring a coherent and fresh musical identity for Radio ABF.</p><h3>Technical &amp; Creative Role</h3><p>Loïc personally oversees the station’s technical side: stream quality (HD/SD), server management, website development, and overall infrastructure — making Radio ABF a fully independent, self-managed project in 2026.</p><p><strong>Quote often associated with his vibe:</strong> « From the first waves of ABF to the endless horizons of sound: music connects us all. »</p><p>Passionate about the electronic sounds that shaped his journey, Loïc Molo continues to bridge the worlds of <strong>radio broadcasting</strong>, <strong>independent music production</strong>, and <strong>technical innovation</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Discover more on his official site: <a href="https://loicmolo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>loicmolo.com</strong></a></p><p>A true architect of French webradio history, Loïc keeps the alternative bass frequencies alive — past, present, and future.</p>
