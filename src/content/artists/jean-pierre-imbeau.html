						<h2><strong>ABF CLUB // SATURDAYS GUEST MIX</strong></h2><h2>&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Jean-Pierre IMBEAU</strong> (known as <strong>DJ JPI</strong>) is a <strong>Canadian DJ</strong> based in <strong>Quebec</strong>, with a career spanning nearly four decades in the electronic music scene.</p><h3>Early Career &amp; Rise in the 80s</h3><p>Jean-Pierre began DJing in the <strong>mid-1980s</strong>, quickly establishing himself as one of the go-to selectors in Quebec clubs. At a time when house and dance music were still emerging, he stood out thanks to his <strong>exclusive selection</strong> of imported records sourced directly from major American and European cities (Chicago, New York, Detroit, London, Berlin, Amsterdam…). His sets mixed the raw energy of early <strong>house</strong> and <strong>dance</strong> with underground gems, earning him a reputation as a true tastemaker in the Canadian nightlife.</p><h3>Influences &amp; Sound</h3><p>His musical DNA is deeply rooted in the pioneers of electronic and alternative sounds. Among his biggest influences:</p><ul><li><strong>New Order</strong></li><li><strong>Depeche Mode</strong></li><li><strong>Front 242</strong></li><li><strong>Moby</strong></li><li><strong>Tiësto</strong></li><li><strong>Armin van Buuren</strong></li><li><strong>Paul van Dyk</strong> …and countless others from the golden eras of synth-pop, EBM, trance, and progressive.</li></ul><p>This eclectic palette translates into sets that are both nostalgic and forward-looking — always groove-driven, emotional, and perfectly balanced.</p><h3>Current Activities: EDM COOL CUTS</h3><p>Every week, Jean-Pierre produces and broadcasts <strong>EDM COOL CUTS</strong>, a live DJ set that highlights the freshest tracks in <strong>house</strong>, <strong>trance</strong>, <strong>techno</strong>, <strong>pop-dance</strong>, and a handful of carefully chosen <strong>timeless classics</strong>. The show is a true showcase of current trends while paying homage to the roots of electronic music.</p><h3>Setup &amp; Signature Touch</h3><p>DJ JPI primarily works with <strong>Serato</strong> software for its flexibility and modern workflow, but he remains deeply attached to <strong>vinyl</strong>. He regularly spins real records, bringing that unmistakable analog warmth — and yes, a few delicious <strong>crackles</strong> — along with ultra-rare <strong>B-side versions</strong> that have become nearly impossible to find in the digital age. This blend of cutting-edge tech and old-school soul is what makes his sets instantly recognizable.</p><p>Still very active in 2026, Jean-Pierre IMBEAU (DJ JPI) continues to deliver weekly doses of fresh electronic music with authenticity, passion, and a true collector’s spirit.</p><p><strong>Quote often linked to his vibe:</strong> « From vinyl crackles to digital drops — the groove never stops. »</p><p>A true veteran of the Canadian electronic scene, <strong>DJ JPI</strong> bridges the 80s underground to today’s global dancefloor — one cool cut at a time.</p>					</div>
