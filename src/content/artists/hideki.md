						<h2><strong>ABF CLUB [ MADE IN JAPAN ] // Every Sunday 21h CET (= 20h UTC)</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DJ Hideki</strong> (stylized as <strong>DJ HIDEKI</strong> or <strong>Hideki</strong>) refers to several Japanese electronic music figures, but the most prominent and frequently referenced in club and DJ contexts is <strong>Hideki Naganuma</strong> (長沼 英樹, born May 16, 1972), a legendary Japanese <strong>composer, DJ, remixer</strong>, and video game music pioneer. Often simply known as <strong>Hideki</strong> in the scene, he bridges club DJ culture with groundbreaking game soundtracks.</p><h3>Early life &amp; background</h3><p>Born in <strong>Otaru, Hokkaido</strong>, Japan, Hideki began his musical journey at the age of <strong>5</strong>, playing the electronic organ under the influence of his older sister. By his teenage years in <strong>Sapporo</strong>, he was heavily inspired by Western artists like <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong> and <strong>Prince</strong>, leading him to compose his own songs. At 14, he decided to pursue a career in music. In the early-to-mid 1990s (1993–1997), he worked professionally as a <strong>club DJ and bartender</strong> in Tokyo, honing his skills in real nightlife venues before transitioning into production.</p><h3>Career &amp; style</h3><p>Hideki joined <strong>Sega</strong> in 1998, where he became world-famous for composing the iconic soundtracks of:</p><ul><li><strong>Jet Set Radio</strong> (2000) – his breakthrough masterpiece</li><li><strong>Jet Set Radio Future</strong> (2003)</li></ul><p>His style is an explosive, genre-blending fusion of <strong>funk</strong>, <strong>hip-hop</strong>, <strong>electronic</strong>, <strong>big beat</strong>, <strong>dance</strong>, <strong>jazz</strong>, <strong>rock</strong>, and <strong>J-pop</strong>, often featuring heavy sampling, chopped vocals, breakbeats, and playful, nonsensical rearrangements. Tracks like "Let Mom Sleep", "Sweet Soul Brother", and "Hideki Naganuma" became cult anthems, perfectly matching the rebellious, urban skating vibe of the games.</p><p>He later contributed to titles like <strong>Sonic Rush</strong> (2005), <strong>Ollie King</strong> (2003), <strong>Air Gear</strong> (anime soundtrack), <strong>Yakuza 5</strong> (2012), and the spiritual successor <strong>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</strong> (2023). His work has been nominated for awards (e.g., Golden Joystick for Soundtrack of the Year) and praised for pushing interactive music boundaries.</p><p>Outside games, his DJ roots shine through in energetic, sample-heavy sets that capture the spirit of Tokyo nightlife — raw, funky, and full of soul.</p><h3>Legacy &amp; activities</h3><p>Hideki's influence extends far beyond Japan: Jet Set Radio's soundtrack helped redefine game music as a cultural force, inspiring generations of producers in electronic, hip-hop, and chiptune scenes. His famous motto — <strong>"Make it funky!!"</strong> — embodies his philosophy of infusing music with exploratory joy, diversity, and dynamism rather than rigid perfection.</p><p>He remains active as a freelance composer and remixer, with his early club DJ experience still evident in his bold, genre-defying approach.</p><p><strong>Quote often linked to his vibe:</strong> « Make it funky!! » (Hideki Naganuma)</p><p>A true icon of Japanese electronic culture, DJ Hideki (Naganuma) turned club-honed skills into timeless game anthems, leaving an indelible mark on global dance and gaming music. Still funky after all these years.</p>
