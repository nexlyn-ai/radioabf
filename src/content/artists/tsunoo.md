						<h2>ABF CLUB // SATURDAYS GUEST MIX</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tsunoo</strong> is a <strong>French DJ</strong> and a <strong>true pioneer</strong> of <strong>Radio ABF</strong> (Alternative Bass Fréquence), recognized as one of the station's <strong>historical figures</strong> from its very early days in <strong>1999</strong>.</p><p>Active in the electronic music scene during the golden era of French webradio emergence, Tsunoo was among the first wave of DJs who helped shape Radio ABF's identity as an independent platform dedicated to <strong>dance</strong>, <strong>house</strong>, <strong>electro</strong>, and <strong>bass</strong> sounds. At a time when streaming was in its infancy and the internet was still emerging as a medium for music broadcasting, Tsunoo brought raw energy, sharp selections, and authentic passion to the airwaves, contributing to the station's rapid rise among early online listeners.</p><p>His style reflects the late 90s / early 2000s electronic vibe: timeless <strong>classics</strong>, underground gems, high-energy house tracks, and a nostalgic yet powerful club feeling that defined the beginnings of French digital radio.</p><p>After years away from the spotlight (or in a lower profile), Tsunoo made a <strong>highly anticipated comeback</strong> in January 2026, returning to Radio ABF for a special <strong>ABF Club</strong> session on Saturday, January 17 — a rare moment that allowed fans to relive the authentic spirit of the station's origins. This appearance was celebrated as a bridge between the pioneering era and today's vibrant webradio community.</p><p><strong>Quote often linked to his vibe:</strong> « Back to the roots — the beats that started it all. »</p><p>A legendary name etched in Radio ABF history, <strong>Tsunoo</strong> represents the passion and pioneering spirit of the first generation of French online electronic DJs — still capable of igniting the dancefloor with pure nostalgia and groove after more than 25 years.</p>
